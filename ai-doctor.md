The application is a simple bot which based on your key metrics verify your health.
When we run the application Doctor should ask you for your key metrics.

You can send as many key metrics as you want.

If you send key metric which is not supported you should receive message with allowed key metrics.

Key Metrics should be saved in valid format. If not valid send a proper message.
You should be able to ask for a status of particular key metric but also for a diagnosis.

### Example conversation:

```
Doctor:â€‚  Welcome. I am Doctor AI. What are your key metrics?
Patient:  Age 24
Patient:  Weight 70 kg, Height 180 cm, Blood Pressure 139/89
