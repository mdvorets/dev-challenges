Create an original work that highlights some of your ability to contribute to CipherHealth's engineering team.

Guidelines:
- Project is expected to reflect 2-4 hours of coding, but there is no limit to how much time you can put in if you find the project to be interesting
- You may use any language and work in any environment.
- The work must be original for this exercise. You may of course include gems/modules/libraries, but the basis of the work should be original.
